This is how I see this project being structured

database object/module:
    handles storing/accessing data in the sqlite database file

scanner object/module:
    handles scanning and hashing of files
    relies on the database module to determine if something has been scanned before

spider object/module:
    finds firmware images to analyze on the internet
    can be run independantly
